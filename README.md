# Image-Captioning-Model
This project generates descriptive captions for images using deep learning. It processes the Flickr8k dataset, extracts image features with an untrained VGG16 CNN, and trains an encoder-decoder LSTM network to map image features to text. A greedy search algorithm is used to iteratively generate the most likely caption for any given image.
